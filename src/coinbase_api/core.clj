   probability-bets: a reference (var, atom etc) to a mapping of cumulative
   probability to bet-scale. bet-scale is the proportion of funds to use in
   this round of orders compared to other probabilities. eg (atom {0.1 0.4,
   0.01 0.6, 0.9 0.4, 0.99 0.6}) (use 40% of each currency on the 1:10
   probability, and 60% on the 1:100 probability). Any probability over 0.5 is
   a sell, under 0.5 is a buy.

   timescale-params: a ref containing a vector of [ttl mu sigma]. The ttl is
   how long (in ms) the limit order will be in force before it is cancelled (if
   not already filled). mu and sigma are parameters used to calculate the price
   to place orders at, given the current price and probability. see
   expected-price

   overlap-factor: orders stay active for ttl, but if you specify
   overlap-factor > 1, new orders will be placed before old ones
   expire. eg, using ttl of 10 minutes and overlap factor of 5 will
   result in orders being placed every 2 minutes.

   match-pub: a core.async publication to subscribe to order fill
   messages from the exchange. see pub-sub.

   shutdown-ch: a channel, when you close that channel this loop will exit. It
   tries to cancel all outstanding orders before exiting, but this is not
